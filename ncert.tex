\item Consider the experiment of throwing a die, if a multiple of 3 comes up, throw the die again and if any other number comes, toss a coin. Find the conditional probability of the event 'the coin shows a tail',given that 'atlest one die shows a 3'.
\item A die is thrown again and again until three sixes are obtained. Find the probability of obtaining the third six in the sixth throw of the die.
\item Let X represent the difference between the number of heads and the number of
tails obtained when a coin is tossed 6 times. What are possible values of X?
